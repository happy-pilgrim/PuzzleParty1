To run the program, open a command prompt (cmd in Windows)
Once it appears, type:

	cd <path-to-the-folder-the-class-file-is-in>

ie, 

	cd C:\Users\Alexander\Downloads

Type "dir" to print a list of items in the folder, and be sure Puzzle2.class is there.
Then type:

	java Puzzle2

This should run the program, if java is installed, and interacting with it should be straightforward.
If it doesn't work (ie, "java" is not a recognized command, or something like that) let me know.
